Known Limitations
=================

Although Kerberos is supported by OneFS, this document
does not address a Hadoop environment secured with Kerberos. Instead,
refer to `EMC Isilon Best Practices for Hadoop Data
Storage <http://www.emc.com/collateral/white-paper/h12877-wp-emc-isilon-hadoop-best-practices.pdf>`__.
