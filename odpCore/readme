This location will house all relevant documentation snippets for ODP based
distributions of Apache Hadoop.  The present release of the HSK will concern
itself with Hortonworks, Pivotal, and IBM.  But going forward adding Additional
ODP distributions into the documentaton will be fairly quick.  Only steps
specific to that distribution will need changing.

There is a odpDistroTemplate folder that will house a template for newer ODP
initiatives.  Simply copy that folder to the name of your new distribution and then
make any modifications you need to for that new distribution.  In this way any ODP
partner documentation can be quickly pulled into the HSK.
